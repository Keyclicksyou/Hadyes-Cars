                <h1>10. Toyota <span style="color: white">GR</span><span style="color: red">86</span></h1>
                <p>We reach the first entry to the list with one of toyota's most anticipated sports cars
                   being the limited run Toyota GR86 which sold out within 90 minutes in the UK! This car contains
                   a naturally aspirated 2.4L boxer 4 cylinder creating 234 horsepower with 250 nm of torque while
                   being rear wheel drive and also containing an LSD. Toyota went driver's style with this entry 
                   completely outshadowing the GT86. The wheels are also inspired by blades which I found a cool detail.
                   The car can come equipped with either a 6 speed manual or automatic gearbox giving the car
                   some personalisation on the preferred transmission. Finding out about this car in 2024 fascinated me with its limited
                   entry run and amazing performance package. Too bad that they are sold out since it is a limited run
                   after all!

                <h1>9. GMA <span style="color: #00529c;">T.50</span></h1>
                <p>Number 9 brings us to the GMA (Gordon Murray Automotive) T.50.
                   This car pays homage to one of my favourite vehicles of all time being the
                   Mclaren F1! The T.50 is a 2023 built sports car sporting a brand new V12 engine
                   producing 654 horsepower with 467 NM of torque. Despite how it may look,
                   the T.50 is one of the lightest in its class weighing at 987kg giving an
                   extremely good power to weight ratio of 672 hp per tonne. One of the most
                   noticeable features of this vehicle is the huge fan at the rear powered by a
                   48 volt electrical motor. This motor improves ground effect by sucking air under
                   the car to provide additional downforce! This beautiful vehicle has 100 units with
                   25 track units making this a low number icon respecting the early F1. This car is a light,
                   delicate air handling menace travelling through the roads as an arrow soars over the battlefield
                   landing it a beautiful spot at number 9.

                <p>The Lotus Evora is a beautiful turning point in Lotus' career
                   as the introduction of this car was the newest vehicle platform 
                   since the Elise in which the Exige and Europa S are built on!
                   This car was a standalone beauty built to be a track toy while also
                   remaining sensible for daily road use. The vehicle shown in the images
                   is actually the Evora S heritage racing edition which features unique styling
                   illustrating Lotus' beautiful racing history.The car came in either 6 speed manual
                   or automatic. The evora is much more up to date
                   than the others giving it a more modernised driving experience with models up to 2016.
                   The car comes packed with a 3.5l Toyota V6 which also has a supercharged variant producing
                   416 horsepower and 430 NM of torque. I have been a huge lotus fan this year so expect another
                   to pop up in the lower rankings!

                <h1>7. 1974 Porsche <span style="color: #bc5400">911</span></h1>
                <p>I recently took a trip to Holland to see my father and the car scene was beauitful!
                   Classics were always around the corner and so was I ready with my camera. But I have seen
                   many of the classic Porsche 911's and fell in love with them all over again! (Fun Fact: the Top
                   photo was taken by me!!) The 1974 911's had a more increased power 2.7l flat 6 producing
                   148 horsepower. The 911s had the same engine with 175 horses while the carrera variant produced
                   210 horsepower being the European spec I also saw during my trip!. The car came
                   with either a 5 speed manual or a 3 speed sportomatic which was a semi automatic
                   gearbox made to make driving more accessbile to those who didn't want to operate 
                   the clutch. The style 
                   including unique impact bumpers and variety of performance gave Porsche a dominant market position 
                   at this time. They sure caught my eyes 50 years later! (The carrera 2.7 will be used for performance
                   specs)

                <h1>6. Ferrari <span style="color: white;">Daytona SP3</span></h1>
                <p>"The Last V12 Child of Enzo" the Ferrari Daytona SP3 caught my eye when I decided
                    to purchase and build the lego technic version of it. This car is part of a limited
                    recent series of vehicles called the Icona series. Built in 2023, this will be the final 
                    naturally aspirated V12 Ferrari ever. The car runs on a 7 speed DCT with a 6.5l V12 making
                    829 Horsepower. The design itself is like that of a retro futuristic vehicle whicn, in my
                    opinion, is how all newer cars should look! The car's design is based off of a prior vehicle, of course,
                    being the Ferrari 330 P4 which won at 24 hours of Daytona in 1967. I fell in love with this car as soon as i
                    saw its design and it truly does live up to the legacy of ferrari. My favourite part of the design has to be the rear.
                    It looks like something out of a cyberpunk movie with that visor of a tail light.

                <p>The MK3 Leon is quite a sentimental car to me as I discussed. The 
                   memories from my brother's FR stil stay with me to this day. We come to the car 
                   holding the midpoint of this list. The MK3 Cupra. Produced between 2012 and 2020,
                   the MK3 contains a 2.0 TSI Turbocharged inline-4 producing 300 horsepower. The car came 
                   in either 6 speed manual or DSG Automatic for smooth track like shifts. The cupra 
                   was known for its agile cornering due to it being a light hatchback making it a wonderful
                   choice for true enthusiasts who want something more than just the Leon FR. The car was 
                   also more affordable compared to the Audi S3 or Golf GTI while still holding high performance
                   value. The car was one of the first in its class to feature variable valve timing and Turbocharged 
                   stratified injection technology which provided aggressive power while also keeping fuel economical!
                   This car is and forever will be one of the most prettiest hatches to me from its striking big cat like design 
                   in its headlights and structure.

                <p>There's the M3,4 and 5. But what if I want something
                   smaller that I can hurl around corners with amazing power 
                   following up right after? Thats where the 2016 M2 comes into 
                   picture. A compact package housing the spirit of the M sport. This car
                   houses a 3.0l 453 horsepower twin turbo'd inline 6 with 465 NM of torque 
                   giving this car explosive power to slam on after bends. This, in my opinion,
                   is the perfect BMW sporting power, handling and a sleek and beautiful design highlighting 
                   the aggression this car will release on all asphalt. This car comes chambered in either a 6 speed 
                   manual with seamless rev-match technology for crisp downshifts or an 8 speed M steptronic 
                   automatic transmission for track style vindication. I have always been a fan of this car
                   so it is hard not to include this in my 2024 favourites!

                <h1>3. Lotus <span style="color: #515D4E;">Exige</span> Cup 260</h1>
                <p>We have now reached the top three! I have been an avid fan of Lotus 
                   this year and the exige is my most favourite of them all. The cup 260
                   variant is a limited track focused version of the vehicle designed to be thrown
                   around corners with its light weight of 928 kg. The vehicle is powered by a 
                   1.8l supercharged Inline 4 from toyota producing 260 horsepower. It came chambered 
                   in a 6 speed manual for that driver's experience. This track demon gives pure adrenaline
                   featuring an added large rear wing, front splitter and underbody diffuser to create that 
                   downforce when whirling at higher speeds. Built on the 2007 exige chassis, this vehicle preserves 
                   its image of being a dominate force representing all of what Lotus stands for. This car screams lightweight 
                   track toy even having a lighter weighted battery just to shave off those extra kilograms. Only 50 units 
                   of this beautiful sports demon making it a sought after collector's item.

                <p>Number two goes to the ST. Ford knows how to dominate the hatchback scene.
                   The vehicle itself is dearly loved in its era by the community because it captures
                   the heart of what a performance hatch should be. The car sports a 1.6l ecoboost inline 4 delivering
                   180 horsepower turbocharged to deliver that torque when desired by the driver. Speed and power isn't everything
                   on a car. Wanna know why? Well he car itself was built 
                   on a great chassis making the mk 7 my favourite due to its responsive handling and light weight build of 1172kg
                   making this vehicle very powerful around bends and corners. I actually saw an upgraded one of these zoom past an apex
                   shocking me and making me fall in love with the car. This chassis of the fiesta can handle great even making the base models 
                   a fun drive which does showcase ford's genius when building it. The ST180 is still, to this day, highly regarded and 
                   talked about in the car community giving this a deserved number two ranking. I love hatchbacks the most out of any other body style so 
                   what could number one be?

                <h1>1. <span style="color: darkred;">GR Yaris</span> Circuit Pack</h1>
                <p>We reach my current dream car and favourite car of this year.
                   The GR Yaris is what Toyota proved to be one of the most ultimate cars 
                   developed in recent years. This car blows a fresh gust of air upon the hot hatch game
                   completely changing it with birth. A vehicle with true track potential. The GR Yaris Circuit Pack 
                   is powered by a 1.6l 3 cylinder turbocharged engine creating 268 horsepower with 390 NM of torque 
                   creating an, essentially, pocket rocket. The car comes chambered in a 6 speed manual with the optional button tap 
                   to turn rev matching on and off giving a true driver's experience. The car also is an all wheel driver which is 
                   absolutely insane for a hatchback! This gives precise and perfect handling around corners. The Circuit Pack comes with
                   upgraded suspension and dampers, an LSD to help the car maintain cornering grip and anti roll bars 
                   for even more control. Toyota envisioned their rally heritage when making this car which enables a super fun 
                   experience while also being a road legal daily hatchback for all your practical needs.
