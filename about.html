                <h1>Skills</h1>
                <p>I am very well dorsed in CSS and HTML. I am currently learning JavaScript at college and at home 
                   while also learning SQL for future plans and projects. I also have had a year's experience with python
                   learning libraries such as tkinter, pygame and matplotlib. I am self autonomous
                   and can handle multitasking well while always trying
                   to deliver high quality work. My current ambition is to be employed
                   in an apprenticeship in the digital sector such as web development, data, software etc. I am eager to show off 
                   what I can do and really believe I would prove to be a great asset to a company because I am able to work as a team player
                   to deliver perfect solutions in wherever I am placed. I have been close with computers since I was six years old
                   drawn to screens and fascinated by technology. I believe 
                   heading into this field of work is truly what I want and am capable of and I will be glad and persistent if given an opportunity.
                </p>

                <h1><span style="color: #77500f;">Work</span> Experience</h1>
                <p>I have had quite the experience at Neo-Marketing in Burnley. Currently employed 
                   there as a work experience at the moment with over 130 hours clocked. I worked together with colleagues to use 
                   photoshop to deliver digital designs to clients such as logos, business cards and leaflets.
                   One client was a builder company with a van called 'Eyad' and it took many drafted designs of what 
                   could go on his van by me and my team. In the end we did get it though which proved to be a great and rewarding
                   feat! I have also worked at my Father's store managing stock and updating his database for 100 hours in summer break.
                   This proved to be easy for me since I could pick this up easily and kept it organised.
                   Feel free to contact me about my work experience! </p>
