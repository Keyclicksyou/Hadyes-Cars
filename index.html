            <h1>Welcome to Hadye's Cars!</h1>
            <p>This is a project website which combines my interesting of coding and cars to bring to you a top 10 rankingof my current favourites with 
                performance specifications aswell as some things about me to demonstrate my CSS skills! I will demonstrate what I have learnt about CSS including flexbox and grid. </p>

            <h1>Why Build <span style="color: #77500f;">This</span> Website?</h1>
            <p>This website serves as a cornerstone of my abilities  and
            passions and I believed combining two of the things that I love 
        to create a showcase site for others to see and show off my potential was the way
    to go so enjoy my site and go take a look at my ranking! It also puts the skills
that I have learnt about HTML and CSS to the test so it proved to be a great project to make to highlight
what I have learnt and potentially show it off to others. I also have some future plans to enhance This
site in the future with some JavaScript and more so be prepared for that!</p>

        <h1>Why <span style="color: #77500f;">I</span> love cars</h1>
        <p>Since I was 6 I had loved collecting hot wheels and indulging in anything
            to do with automobiles.  It was also thanks to my brother exposing me to his many
            beautiful cars he owned and got to drive while seating his astonished little brother for opening the doors
            for me to enjoy the culture! His personal favourite car of mine has to be his 2016 Seat Leon <span style="color: red; font-weight: 700;">F</span><span style="color: #77500f; font-weight: 700;">R</span>. The memories made
            in that car with its amazing performance for an everyday driving FWD made it wonderful to have been in and I love him for 
            the memories we have made together!
