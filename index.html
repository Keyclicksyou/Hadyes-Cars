            <h1>Welcome to Hadye's Cars!</h1>
            <p>This is a project website which combines my interesting of coding and cars to bring to you a top 10 ranking of my current favourites with 
                performance specifications aswell as a portfolio showcasing my other projects! This website itself is not made with react or hosted with Vercel.
            It was made in a time where I did not know much about web development except HTML and CSS which is why it is so special and was chosen to be my portfolio. </p>

            <p>This website serves as a cornerstone of my abilities and
            portfolio to showcase my other projects for others to see. So enjoy my site and go take a look at my ranking! This is actually my 3rd change to this website where I added more projects to showcase.</p>

        <h1>Why <span style="color: #77500f;">I</span> love cars</h1>
        <p>Since I was 6 I had loved collecting hot wheels and indulging in anything
            to do with automobiles.  It was also thanks to my brother exposing me to his many
            beautiful cars he owned and got to drive while seating his astonished little brother for opening the doors
            for me to enjoy the culture! His personal favourite car of mine has to be his 2016 Seat Leon <span style="color: red; font-weight: 700;">F</span><span style="color: #77500f; font-weight: 700;">R</span>. The memories made
            in that car with its amazing performance for an everyday driving FWD made it wonderful to have been in and I love him for 
            the memories we have made together!
